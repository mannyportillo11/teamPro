# TeamPro 

## Purpose

To allow users to enter information about their work team and produce a page with all member's contact information.
 
## Motivation

Users need an application to help create a small quick directory of the current organization with names, positions, and contact information. This app helped reinforce knowledge of CSS, JS, and read, writeFile, and the "new"/ prototype functions.

## Tools

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Troubles

Despite successful data acquisition and authentication, I had a hard time generating html and writing to other files. No sample html to display.
